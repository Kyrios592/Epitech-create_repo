Always answer 'N' when it asks "Projet infographie [y/N] ?".

Usage :

Paste the script in your /home/user/bin, update your path in your bashrc/zshrc/etc.

In your /home/user/bin, create a "src" folder, put your Makefile, .gitignore and your libmy in it.

Don't forget to change the login variable in the script.
